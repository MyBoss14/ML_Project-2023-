Leaf Disease Detection

**Leaf Disease Detection using Machine Learning**
This is a machine learning project that aims to detect common plant diseases from leaf images using various classification algorithms. The purpose of this project is to provide a tool that can help farmers and gardeners quickly identify diseased plants, allowing them to take prompt action and prevent further spread of the disease.

**Data Collection and Preprocessing**
The dataset used in this project was collected from various sources and includes images of healthy and diseased leaves of multiple plant species. The images were preprocessed to remove noise, resize them to a uniform size, and convert them to grayscale to reduce computational complexity.

**Feature Extraction and Selection**
Various feature extraction techniques were used to extract meaningful features from the preprocessed leaf images, including color-based, texture-based, and shape-based features. These features were then used to train and test various classification algorithms, including decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM).

**Evaluation Metrics**
The performance of each classification algorithm was evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results were compared to determine the best-performing algorithm for the given dataset.

**Dependencies**
This web application was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, and integrates with Google Teachable Machine and Chart.js libraries. The specific versions of each dependency are listed below:

Google Teachable Machine: 1.0.0
Chart.js: 3.3.2
jQuery: 3.6.0
Popper.js: 2.9.3
Bootstrap: 5.0.1
Font Awesome: 5.15.3
Note that some of these dependencies may have additional dependencies of their own, which are not listed here but are automatically installed when you install the main dependency.

**How to Run**
To run this project, you will need to install the required dependencies and download the dataset. Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the main.py file to train and test the classification algorithms. You can also modify the hyperparameters of the algorithms and the feature extraction techniques to experiment with different configurations.

**Acknowledgments**
This project was inspired by the need to provide a simple and effective tool for detecting leaf diseases in plants. The dataset used in this project was obtained from various sources, including []. We acknowledge the contributions of the authors and organizations who provided the data and made it publicly available.
